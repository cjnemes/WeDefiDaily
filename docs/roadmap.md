- âœ… Governance unlock reminders ([#33](https://github.com/cjnemes/WeDefiDaily/issues/33))
- âœ… Reward decay monitor ([#34](https://github.com/cjnemes/WeDefiDaily/issues/34))
- âœ… Gammaswap health trend insight ([#35](https://github.com/cjnemes/WeDefiDaily/issues/35))

### Phase 5 â€“ Critical Feature Gaps (âœ… Complete)
Successfully addressed missing PRD functionality:
- **P&L & Performance Tracking** (âœ… Complete - Phase 5a)
  - Historical price snapshots and 24h/7d delta calculations
  - Transaction history tracking with cost basis
  - Portfolio performance metrics with chart visualizations
  - API endpoints for historical data queries

- **Liquidity & Trading Analytics** (âœ… Complete - Phase 5b)
  - Pool depth and liquidity metrics from Aerodrome/Gammaswap
  - Position size relative to pool TVL with risk scoring
  - Slippage estimates and optimal routing calculations
  - Impermanent loss calculations for LP positions with breakeven analysis
  - Real wallet integration with live blockchain data validation

- **Advanced Risk Analytics** (âœ… Complete - Phase 5c)
  - Cross-position correlation analysis
  - Protocol exposure concentration warnings
  - Historical volatility tracking
  - Risk-adjusted return metrics

- **Multi-Chain Governance Integration** (âœ… Complete - Phase 5 Critical)
  - veTHE on-chain integration for BSC governance tracking
  - 4-tier fallback strategy for robust data extraction
  - Rate-limited BSC RPC calls with comprehensive error handling
  - Enhanced governance sync pipeline supporting both API and on-chain data

### Phase 6 â€“ UX Foundation (ðŸ”„ In Progress - 3-4 weeks)
Following comprehensive UX testing with Playwright, critical usability barriers have been identified that prevent mainstream adoption. Technical infrastructure is solid, but user experience needs foundational improvements.

**Priority 1 â€“ User Interface Essentials** (1-2 weeks)
- **Wallet Management UI** (High)
  - Replace curl command requirements with intuitive web forms
  - Add wallet creation/import interface with address validation
  - Enable wallet editing, labeling, and removal through UI
  - Implement bulk wallet operations and chain selection

- **Token Filtering System** (High)
  - Address spam token pollution (90+ tokens per wallet including scams)
  - Implement "Show valuable tokens only" toggle with configurable thresholds
  - Add spam detection heuristics and manual token hiding
  - Create clean portfolio views focusing on meaningful holdings

- **Loading States & Feedback** (High)
  - Replace silent button states with proper loading indicators
  - Add progress feedback for sync operations and API calls
  - Implement toast notifications for success/error states
  - Provide clear feedback for all user actions

**Priority 2 â€“ Data Sync UX** (2-3 weeks)
- **In-App Sync Capabilities** (Medium)
  - Replace command-line sync requirements with web UI triggers
  - Add one-click portfolio refresh with progress tracking
  - Implement background sync status monitoring
  - Create guided sync workflow for new users

- **Empty State Improvements** (Medium)
  - Design better first-run experiences with clear next steps
  - Add sample data modes for demonstration purposes
  - Create guided onboarding flow for new users
  - Improve empty state messaging with actionable CTAs

**Priority 3 â€“ Polish & Optimization** (1 week)
- **Data Display Improvements** (Low)
  - Fix duplicate token entries (multiple WETH/ETH showing identical data)
  - Implement proper token grouping and deduplication
  - Add sortable and filterable portfolio views
  - Enhance mobile responsive design

- **Chart Implementation** (Low)
  - Replace "Chart implementation pending" with actual visualizations
  - Add interactive portfolio performance charts
  - Implement token price history visualization

**Success Metrics:**
- New users can add wallets without command-line access
- Portfolio views show clean, meaningful token lists
- All user actions provide clear feedback and loading states
- Zero command-line requirements for basic application usage

**Technical Approach:**
- Preserve all existing API endpoints and CLI capabilities
- Add progressive enhancement layers for UI interactions
- Maintain power-user CLI access while prioritizing web UI
- Use existing technical infrastructure with improved presentation

## Long-Range Exploration

### Phase 4 â€“ Intelligence (âœ… Complete)
- âœ… Intelligence alerts implementation merged (PR #39)
- âœ… All four initial heuristics completed (#32â€“#35)
- âœ… Integrated with digest generation pipeline
- Stretch goals (ROI simulations, scenario planner) remain on umbrella issue #20.

### Phase 5 â€“ Critical Gaps (5-6 weeks)
- Implement historical price tracking and performance deltas
- Build transaction history and P&L calculation engine
- Add liquidity analytics and pool metrics integration
- Create advanced risk correlation analysis
- Deliver missing PRD user stories (US #3, #7)

## Enablers & Ongoing Workstreams
- Add integration tests around governance sync (mock fetch responses).
- Consider Dockerized scheduler or simple cron instructions for jobs.
- Maintain contract registry/configuration, rotate API keys, and monitor CI health.
- Capture manual feedback after each phase to re-prioritize backlog.
